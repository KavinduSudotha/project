3.Next To Buy botton and Clear  botton (this must be in the bottom of the page)
        if clikced on clear botton all the data must be cleared
        if clicked on next to buy botton all the data must be sent to back end and save in database and show a console log  message "Data Saved Successfully" and all the data must be cleared on page


next we cat calculation parts in back end 
      for Coco Chips
          frist get type of Chips and get price of that correponding chip.
          match the type and get the price from database(on cocosys datbase weeklypricelist table
          11 mm unwash =chips_11mm_unwashed
          11 mm wash  = chips_11mm_washed
          9 mm unwash = chips_9mm_unwashed
          9 mm wash   = chips_9mm_washed
          7 mm unwash= chips_7mm_unwashed
          7 mm wash = chips_7mm_washed)

          lets get price a


          lets assume the wastage dedution  price is b.
        
           match the type and get the price from database(on cocosys datbase weeklypricelist table
           wastage_deduction_chips_8=8
           wastage_deduction_chips_9=9
           wastage_deduction_chips_10=10
           wastage_deduction_chips_11=11
           wastage_deduction_chips_12=12
           wastage_deduction_chips_13=13
           wastage_deduction_chips_14=14
           wastage_deduction_chips_15=15
           wastage_deduction_chips_16=16
           wastage_deduction_chips_17=17
           wastage_deduction_chips_18=18
           wastage_deduction_chips_19=19
           wastage_deduction_chips_20=20) 

               suggest price = a-b

          now sent the suggest price to front end and show it in suggest price feild

      for Cocopeat
          frist get type of Cocopeat and get price of that correponding Cocopeat.
          match the type and get the price from database(on cocosys datbase weeklypricelist table
          high ec = cocopeat_hi_ec
          low ec  = cocopeat_low_ec)
          lets get price c

          lets assume the density price is d.
        
           match the type and get the price from database(on cocosys datbase weeklypricelist table
          
          if value is lower than 69 or qual to 69 then density_60_69
          if value is grater 69 and lower than 79 or qual to 79 then density_70_79
          if value is grater 79 and lower than 89 or qual to 89 then density_80_89
          if value is grater 89 and lower than 99 or qual to 99 then density_90_99
          if value is grater 99  then density_100_109 )

           lets assume the sand price is e.
        
           match the type and get the price from database(on cocosys datbase weeklypricelist tabl

          if value is lower than 24 or qual to 24 then sand_20_24
          if value is grater 24 and lower than 29 or qual to 29 then sand_25_29
          if value is grater 29 and lower than 34 or qual to 34 then sand_30_34
          if value is grater 34 and lower than 39 or qual to 39 then sand_35_39
          if value is grater 39 and lower than 44 or qual to 44 then sand_40_44
          if value is grater 44 and lower than 49 or qual to 49 then sand_45_49
          if value is grater 49  then sand_50_54)

               suggest price = c-d-e

          now sent the suggest price to front end and show it in suggest price feild




ok this is calculation part,

so next move on finsh botton iff you click finsh botton then all the data must be sent to back end and save in database and show a console log  message "Data Saved Successfully" .

this is table structer to save data in database

use my privous backend code to connect to database route back end.

give me react page (taiwind css and MUI) and backend code in nodejs
give it 100%  accuracy and 100% working code
